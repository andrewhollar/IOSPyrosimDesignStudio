# Pyrosim Design Studio for IOS

## Synopsis

<a href="https://ccappelle.github.io/pyrosim/">"Pyrosim</a> (Py)thon (Ro)bot (Sim)ulator is a python interface for ODE, primarily focused on neurally controlled robots. With it you can send bodies (cylinders, boxes, etc.), joints, and neural networks."

In this project, we lay the foundations for a design studio iOS app where users can create pyrosim robots without needing to write code.  Once a robot is designed, the user can export their code for use in a pyrosim simulation.

## Motivation

This is our final project for Mobile Apps & Embedded Devices with Jason Hibbeler (UVM, Spring 2019).

## Installation

To run the app, simply download the project and run it using Xcode.

## API Reference

Developed using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit">SceneKit</a>
